# utility-scripts
Some utility scripts I used to make some things more convenient.

1. Some python scripts to batch rename based on some excel sheets
2. Some autohotkey scripts to do something because my failing hardware and I'm too poor to replace them. And some other tasks
3. An excel VBScripts that I used in my litRPG excel workbook.
